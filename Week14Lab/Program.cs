/// @author: Zitlali Martinez
/// Date:  December 05, 2021
///
/// Problem Statement: Write a program that uses 2 methods via a delegate.
/// 
/// 
/// Overall Plan:
/// 1) Create an area method that displays the area of a rectangle.
/// 2) Create a perimeter method that displays the perimeter of a rectangle.
/// 3) Declare a delegate for the rectangle that takes in the height and width.
/// 4) Create a rectangle object
/// 5) Create a delegate object and pass in the area method
/// 6) Call the perimeter method and add it to the delegate object
/// 7) Use the invoke method to pass values into the delegate object

            //Delegates in C# are similar to the function pointer in C/C++. 
            //It provides a way which tells which method is to be called when an event is triggered.
